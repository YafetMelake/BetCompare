# BetCompare

This projects aim is to solve the problem of finding the betting company or site with the best odds for your
specific bet to help maximise your returns, whilst also saving you the time and challenge of having to manually
compare across various platforms.

BetCompare will be a central platform for gambling hobbyists to the professionals aiming to gain an edge.

BetCompare will have an authentication process to ensure users are of age and not bots. After authentication is
complete, users will be able to input their parameters of choice: Country, Sport, League, and Team. In turn
the user will receive a comparison of the odds offered by different betting companies in some order/classification
to make it easy to see which the best betting company for him may be.

The biggest risk for BetCompare is security as the gambling industry is a very sensitive and regulated industry.

We will know we are successful if we are able to successfully compare and display the betting odds for the user
in a user-friendly manner.
